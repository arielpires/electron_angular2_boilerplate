# electron_angular2_boilerplate

A simple desktop app using electron (http://electron.atom.io/) and angular 2 (https://angular.io/).

You must have:
- git: https://git-scm.com/
- node and npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node

To run this example:
- Clone this repo in your machine
- Install the dependencies: npm install
- Run the app: npm start

**Note**: This  is a really simple example project from where you can get started with Electron and Angular 2. This was created based on [this article](https://medium.com/@DenysVuika/using-angular-2-with-electron-a9fa0715cf12#.tn811raqf "Article") created by [Denys Vuika](https://github.com/DenisVuyka "DenisVuyka"), the [Electron quickstart repository](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start "Electron") and the  [Angular quickstart repository](https://github.com/angular/quickstart "Angular").

I wrote a [simple step by step tutorial](./tutorial.md) to create this app, it is good to follow if you want to guarantee the latest versions of the libs: [Tutorial](./tutorial.md).

#TODO
1. Tests;
2. Packaging;
3. Templating;

Fell free to sugest improvements. Pull requests are welcome =).
